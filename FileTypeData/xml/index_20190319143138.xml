      <title>So I got locked in a bookshop</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I began browsing the sci-fi section, looking for trashy stuff mostly, like Harry
Harrison. Having exhausted the obvious stuff I noticed a sign saying &amp;ldquo;more sci-fi
in the back!&amp;rdquo; so I obeyed the call and found big piles of sci-fi to trawl.
Heaven!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should highlight at this point that this bookshop was described by my sister as
&amp;ldquo;the one that plays loud music out onto the street&amp;rdquo; and indeed it was blasting
out jazz this evening - a pleasant and quite endearing habit of theirs, but one
that turned out to be my downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to browse the books and amassed infinitely more in my I&amp;rsquo;ll-probably-
buy-this-stuff pile than I had expected (i.e. my expectation was for zero since
I already have plenty of unread books to plough through!) There&amp;rsquo;s some great
stuff there; from Harry Harrison to Heinlein to LeGuin, and even a Star Trek
book which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty dubious about, but hey it&amp;rsquo;s about Romulans so it&amp;rsquo;s gotta
be good, right?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided that the pile was big enough and that I should probably get
out before I bought half the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around. Nobody. Called &amp;ldquo;HELLO?!&amp;rdquo; a few times. Nothing. I analysed the
situation; the music was still on, as were the lights, there was an uneaten
salad of some variety prepped and ready to dig into. Cool. They must be around
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a couple of doors; one went downstairs and one up. It felt rather like
a mixture of a horror film and one of those old text-based adventures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reach the stairwell: do you want to go [U]p or [D]own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for Down: Up looked dark :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the basement there were a few things; a broken ladder, a couple of locked
toilets, and then more stuff, detritus mostly. Not worth listing in a
text-adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there&amp;rsquo;s nobody here. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the hard-won pile of books near the till
and come back tomorrow. No big deal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh shit. The door is locked. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in someone else&amp;rsquo;s shop and I&amp;rsquo;m alone and
I have no food except someone else&amp;rsquo;s salad and when did I last use the toilet
and will I survive the night?!?! Perhaps panicking wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be so
helpful: deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More investigation of the situation was needed: surely I was being a simpleton
and there was actually a way to open this locked door. Nope. Sealed. Not a yale
lock. Well then - let&amp;rsquo;s think logically about this - there must be spare keys?
Found precisely &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; that looked promising. Didn&amp;rsquo;t fit. My heart sank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, phone numbers then - there must be a mobile scribbled down somewhere! Rescue
is a phone call away! Nope. Ok, think laterally. Visit their website in search
of a number&amp;hellip; nope, only a landline for the shop&amp;hellip; try it anyway in the vain
hope that it&amp;rsquo;s forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RING RING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time, and noting the security camera I decided it might be prudent
to call the police, hopefully demonstrating that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved in the heist
of a bookshop. I quickly got through, apologised in an extremely English manner
for wasting everyone&amp;rsquo;s time, and explained the situation, at which point I must
have been allocated the very lowest priority possible and stuck in a phone
queue being repeatedly informed that more important emergencies were going on
and to stop being a big baby. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s what I read into it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-your-enemy:fe40e36e17e5b65bbd1e8b9fb1c83adb&#34;&gt;Know your enemy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration was the way forward, it seemed, with no official attention (but
holding on for the police to pick up) I ventured forth. Up I went. More
shouting: &amp;ldquo;HELLO?! ANYONE THERE?!&amp;rdquo; thinking &amp;lt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to die&amp;gt;. Seems
overly dramatic, but read on! Coulda happened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floors of books, and knick-knacks, and less books as I went up: top floor was
largely empty - another ladder, not so broken looking, and jackpot! FIRE EXIT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the damn thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open - the push-bar thing was stuck and I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t urge it open, so I gave it a sharp kick and smelt the fresh air!
I felt like Mel Gibson leading the charge against the
melodramatically-and-largely-misrepresented English in Braveheart. FREEDOM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was open about 2 inches and now it was stuck. Really stuck. I
booted it a couple more times for good measure but it didn&amp;rsquo;t shift and I was
worried about breaking stuff. I decided to use the old lift-and-apply-pressure
technique. Cue sound of rotten wood giving way. Oops. Broke the top hinge. On
the plus side I could now get out, which I did, and then nipped back in and
down to the till to write a letter of apology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You locked me in your shop! I tried calling you but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find your mobile.
I searched for a spare key to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a fire escape door at the top floor and pushed hard to open it, but
the wood was rotten and the top hinge broke! I&amp;rsquo;m sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to call the police for 20mins but they put my on hold so I&amp;rsquo;ll
try the fire escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll pop in tomorrow to buy the books! [arrow drawn here to the treasure-trove
of discovered books - my main concern at this point was genuinely that they
might re-file my treasure-trove!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Adam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back up I went, out onto the fire escape which I discovered was really rusty and
a lot higher up than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really like heights! At this point the
police picked up and I apologised profusely and gave a short summary of events
culminating in my position at the top of a dodgy fire-escape, the door for which
I left ajar just in case I needed it - possibly the most sensible thing I&amp;rsquo;ve
ever done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice bloke on the end of the line suggested that if I felt safe I should try
using the fire escape, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to seem too pathetic, having already
been locked in a shop by mistake, and gave it a whirl. The first step was solid
and I gained enough confidence to stride onto the next - which immediately
loosened and gave way on one side. This was a sobering moment indeed. Shit was
definitely real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not willing to let such trivialities as death-by-fall-and-impaling get in the
way of a good escape I proceeded carefully down until I got to the first floor
which had had its escape ladder chained up and padlocked. The padlock looked
stronger than the entire set of stairs put together. I considered a heroic jump
to the floor but the nice man on the line suggested that this was perhaps not
the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He left me alone at that point for us both to regroup: he had to try to contact
the owners, and I had to re-climb the steps-of-little-integrity and wait for
rescue in the shop. It was out of my hands now - kinda reassuring in a pathetic
sort of way. I welcomed opportunity to use two hands now that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t holding
my phone and ascended, breaking bits off here and there and trying to retain my
sanity whilst considering my ridiculous death. Thankfully the door was still
open when I reached the top - I had already resigned to the inevitability that
it would&amp;rsquo;ve swung shut in the minimal wind so this was a positive development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resolved to wait, and have a read whilst I was there - may as well make use of
the perks available, right? After a few pages I got fed up waiting and called
the police back with my incident number and had a good laugh about my situation
with the very nice lady on the line - one should always appreciate one&amp;rsquo;s
ridiculous misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had the foresight to enquire as to how much battery I had remaining: 33%
but I pointed out that I was manning the phones in the bookshop this evening so
if they needed me I was pretty available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had had no luck contacting the owner and were sending someone over.
Confused at what this someone might be able to achieve, and not welcoming the
spectacle of a fire-engine rescue, I went back to reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police turned up and suggested that I could get back down the fire-escape
and they could bring a ladder, but by this point I&amp;rsquo;d decided a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure the fire escape would be charitable enough to stay up for a
redux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was going to take a while anyway, so why rush things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began discussing the fire brigade again and my heart sank. I could picture a
fireman triumphantly carrying me over his manly shoulder - the pathetic wretch
he supported not even able to escape a mere bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, this is my shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God finally got bored of torturing me for cheap laughs. The owner was back!
One-and-a-half hours after leaving me to my doom. He&amp;rsquo;d gone for a coffee, and
this was the one time in 30 years running the shop that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t shouted &amp;ldquo;FIRE
DRILL! EVERYONE OUT!&amp;rdquo; before locking up. I was just relieved that not too much
fuss had been made, and was of course very apologetic about the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be back tomorrow to buy that pile of books - they don&amp;rsquo;t take card, as it
turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seinfeld Method</title>
      <link>http://www.ahri.net/2014/02/seinfeld-method/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems apt to start my new one-a-day blogging by discussing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret&#34;&gt;Seinfeld Method&lt;/a&gt;
which has stood me in good stead for a number of different habits. But I&amp;rsquo;m
getting ahead of myself; I should explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation:e3b2d1aec77b4de4835daddcb4a91d04&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you can wrest control of your habits away from your
subconscious - instead of being controlled by them. This means both creating
new habits and breaking those undesirable bits and pieces you have lodged in
your mind that you do without conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;habits:e3b2d1aec77b4de4835daddcb4a91d04&#34;&gt;Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is a habit anyway? Wikipedia &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A habit (or wont) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and
tends to occur unconsciously.&amp;rdquo; I think this is a helpful definition; it shows
off the strength that we can harness by taking control and using this artefact
of human psyche for our own, initially conscious, benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gist:e3b2d1aec77b4de4835daddcb4a91d04&#34;&gt;The Gist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Seinfeld felt that just by doing something each day: making sure you really
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it, you make it easier to keep doing it. He was applying it to writing
comedy, but I&amp;rsquo;m applying it in a few different areas: I used it to break my
habit of biting my nails, for example!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple: you use a big, real life,
highly-visible calendar and mark off the days where you did, or didn&amp;rsquo;t do, the
thing you said you were going to do, or stop doing. Simple, right? The &amp;ldquo;chain&amp;rdquo;
part of it comes in where you don&amp;rsquo;t like to leave holes in your calendar - it
looks untidy - so you have this extra bit of motivation to execute the action
and cross off a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gotchas:e3b2d1aec77b4de4835daddcb4a91d04&#34;&gt;Gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve used this method for a year or so and applied it in a number of ways
and found that you need to use a few guidelines in order to use it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use vague objectives; don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;I want to go to the gym every day&amp;rdquo;, instead
say &amp;ldquo;I want to do exercise every day&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; this allows you to have a lazy day
now and then, or to do alternative exercise when you&amp;rsquo;re on holiday, i.e.
make sure that the goal is achievable each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some goals require detail and that detail stops you doing them each day if
something comes up; e.g. I have some objectives around coding on a specific
project, where just doing miscellaneous coding wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do (because I like
neglecting projects&amp;hellip;) So you need to allow yourself &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; days off
where you know you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do this activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that needing to do this is a hint that you&amp;rsquo;re going too specific
   and should really be trying to back off and make the goal more manageable
   and flexible. So your preference should be to ease the goal instead of
   adding in a level of paperwork like this that could spell the failure of
   your objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-life, month-sized, single objective calendars are the way to go: you
might think that this will make managing many objectives difficult, and
you&amp;rsquo;d be right. Think of it as a hint that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t push yourself so
hard! Physical calendars are really a must as they&amp;rsquo;re much harder to ignore
than some ephemeral digital version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-am-i-done:e3b2d1aec77b4de4835daddcb4a91d04&#34;&gt;When am I done?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many things this is a judgement call: you&amp;rsquo;re done when you no longer
feel that executing your desired action takes any effort; you do that thing
naturally, without needing to make space for it in your schedule &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s now a
core part of your day. You can throw the calendar out and consider building or
breaking a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
