<p>In other words, do not use periods for commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from
Liverpool to New York.</p>
<p>He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over
the world, and lived in half a dozen countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a
comma, and the following word begun with a small letter.</p>
<p>It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve
the purpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again and again he called out. No reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is
warranted, and that he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in
punctuation.</p>
<p>Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover the most important principles in the
punctuation of ordinary sentences; they should be so thoroughly
mastered that their application becomes second nature.</p>
