          This Modified OSIS file was generated from a USFX source as part of
          the process to convert to a SWORD module using Haiola open source
          software from http://haiola.org. Some non-canonical parts of the USFX
          source file that are not currently supported by The Sword Project
          (http://crosswire.org) were stripped out, as were some of the pure
          presentational elements that make no sense in a Bible study program,
          but the canonical Scripture text and punctuation remain. Sometimes
          more than one source format markup was mapped to the same OSIS markup,
          which may result in some minor formatting changes. The usage of the
          &lt;q&gt; element in this file is not compliant with the OSIS User
          Manual in that &lt;q&gt; markup is stopped and restarted at all verse
          boundaries, and NEVER intended to trigger generation of any
          punctuation. ALL correct punctuation for quotations for this language,
          dialect, and translation style, if any, are already in the text of the
          Scriptures. This is why the n attribute of &lt;q&gt; is always the
          empty string. Because of these limitations, this file may be good to
          include in archives, BUT not to the exclusion of the source USFM,
          USFX, or USX file(s) from which this Modified OSIS file was generated.
