<h3 class="section_title">4. Put statements in positive form.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating,
non-committal language. Use the word&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;as a
means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was not very often on time.<br />
He usually came late.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He did not think that studying Latin was much use.<br />
He thought the study of Latin useless.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare
does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does
Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in
Shakespeare's works.<br />
The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is
disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as
negative. The corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at
the writer's intention.</p>
<p>All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word not.
Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being
told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a
rule, it is better to express a negative in positive form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not honest, dishonest</p>
<p>not important, trifling</p>
<p>did not remember, forgot</p>
<p>did not pay any attention to, ignored</p>
<p>did not have much confidence in, distrusted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The antithesis of negative and positive is strong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not charity, but simple justice.</p>
<p>Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Negative words other than not are usually strong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun never sets upon the British flag.</p>
