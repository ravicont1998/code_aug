<h3 class="section_title">3. Enclose parenthetic expressions
between commas.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time,
is to travel on foot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide
whether a single word, such as however, or a brief phrase, is or is
not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is
but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the
interruption be slight or considerable, he must never omit one
comma and leave the other. Such punctuation as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit
yesterday,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect
health,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is indefensible.</p>
<p>Non-restrictive relative clauses are, in accordance with this
rule, set off by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more
and more interested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar clauses introduced
by&#160;<em>where</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>when</em>&#160;are
similarly punctuated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been
acquired by France.</p>
<p>Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner, is a few miles from Bridgewater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these sentences the clauses introduced by which, when, and
where are non-restrictive; they do not limit the application of the
words on which they depend, but add, parenthetically, statements
supplementing those in the principal clauses. Each sentence is a
combination of two statements which might have been made
independently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and
more interested.</p>
<p>Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently
been acquired by France.</p>
<p>Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner at Nether
Stowey. Nether Stowey is only a few miles from Bridgewater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restrictive relative clauses are not set off by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the
place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sentence the relative clause restricts the application
of the word candidate to a single person. Unlike those above, the
sentence cannot be split into two independent statements.</p>
<p>The
abbreviations&#160;<em>etc.</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>jr.</em>&#160;are
always preceded by a comma, and except at the end of a sentence,
followed by one.</p>
<p>Similar in principle to the enclosing of parenthetic expressions
between commas is the setting off by commas of phrases or dependent
clauses preceding or following the main clause of a sentence. The
sentences quoted in this section and under Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 16,
and 18 should afford sufficient guidance.</p>
<p>If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place
the first comma before the conjunction, not after it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his
treachery, greeted us with a smile.</p>
</blockquote>
