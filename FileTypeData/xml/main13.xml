<h3 class="section_title">5. Omit needless words.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no
unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the
same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a
machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer
make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat
his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.</p>
<p>Many expressions in common use violate this principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the question as to whether, whether (the question whether)</p>
<p>there is no doubt but that, no doubt (doubtless)</p>
<p>used for fuel purposes, used for fuel</p>
<p>he is a man who, he</p>
<p>in a hasty manner, hastily</p>
<p>this is a subject which, this subject</p>
<p>His story is a strange one. His story is strange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In especial the expression&#160;<em>the fact
that</em>&#160;should be revised out of every sentence in which it
occurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>owing to the fact that, since (because)</p>
<p>in spite of the fact that, though (although)</p>
<p>call your attention to the fact that, remind you (notify
you)</p>
<p>I was unaware of the fact that, I was unaware that (did not
know)</p>
<p>the fact that he had not succeeded, his failure</p>
<p>the fact that I had arrived, my arrival</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also
under&#160;<em>case</em>,&#160;<em>character</em>,&#160;<em>nature</em>,&#160;<em>system</em>&#160;in
Chapter V.</p>
<p><em>Who is</em>,&#160;<em>which was</em>, and the like are often
superfluous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His brother, who is a member of the same firm<br />
His brother, a member of the same firm</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle<br />
Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As positive statement is more concise than negative, and the
active voice more concise than the passive, many of the examples
given under Rules 11 and 12 illustrate this rule as well.</p>
<p>A common violation of conciseness is the presentation of a
single complex idea, step by step, in a series of sentences which
might to advantage be combined into one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king
of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come
true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by
his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed
Duncan as king. (55 words.)</p>
<p>Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and
realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and
becoming king of Scotland in his place. (26 words.)</p>
