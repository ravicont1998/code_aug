Elementary Principles of Composition</h2>
<div id="section_98361" class="section">
<h3 class="section_title">1. Make the paragraph the unit of
composition: one paragraph to each topic.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or
if you intend to treat it very briefly, there may be no need of
subdividing it into topics. Thus a brief description, a brief
summary of a literary work, a brief account of a single incident, a
narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single
idea, any one of these is best written in a single paragraph. After
the paragraph has been written, it should be examined to see
whether subdivision will not improve it.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, however, a subject requires subdivision into topics,
each of which should be made the subject of a paragraph. The object
of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is, of course, to
aid the reader. The beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him
that a new step in the development of the subject has been
reached.</p>
<p>The extent of subdivision will vary with the length of the
composition. For example, a short notice of a book or poem might
consist of a single paragraph. One slightly longer might consist of
two paragraphs:</p>
&lt;
<p>ol type="A"&gt;</p>
<p>Account of the work.</p>
<p>Critical discussion.</p>
<p>A report on a poem, written for a class in literature, might
consist of seven paragraphs:</p>
&lt;
<p>ol type="A"&gt;</p>
<p>Facts of composition and publication.</p>
<p>Kind of poem; metrical form.</p>
<p>Subject.</p>
<p>Treatment of subject.</p>
<p>For what chiefly remarkable.</p>
<p>Wherein characteristic of the writer.</p>
<p>Relationship to other works.</p>
<p>The contents of paragraphs C and D would vary with the poem.
Usually, paragraph C would indicate the actual or imagined
circumstances of the poem (the situation), if these call for
explanation, and would then state the subject and outline its
development. If the poem is a narrative in the third person
throughout, paragraph C need contain no more than a concise summary
of the action. Paragraph D would indicate the leading ideas and
show how they are made prominent, or would indicate what points in
the narrative are chiefly emphasized.</p>
<p>A novel might be discussed under the heads:</p>
&lt;
<p>ol type="A"&gt;</p>
<p>Setting.</p>
<p>Plot.</p>
<p>Characters.</p>
<p>Purpose.</p>
<p>A historical event might be discussed under the heads:</p>
&lt;
<p>ol type="A"&gt;</p>
<p>What led up to the event.</p>
<p>Account of the event.</p>
<p>What the event led up to.</p>
<p>In treating either of these last two subjects, the writer would
probably find it necessary to subdivide one or more of the topics
here given.</p>
<p>As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as
paragraphs. An exception may be made of sentences of transition,
indicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or
argument.</p>
<p>In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is a
paragraph by itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each
change of speaker. The application of this rule, when dialogue and
narrative are combined, is best learned from examples in
well-printed works of fiction.</p>
