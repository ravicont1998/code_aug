<h3 class="section_title">2. In a series of three or more terms
with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the
last.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Thus write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>red, white, and blue</p>
<p>honest, energetic, but headstrong</p>
<p>He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its
contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also the usage of the Government Printing Office and of
the Oxford University Press.</p>
<p>In the names of business firms the last comma is omitted, as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brown, Shipley and Company</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The abbreviation&#160;<em>etc.</em>, even if only a single term
comes before it, is always preceded by a comma.</p>
