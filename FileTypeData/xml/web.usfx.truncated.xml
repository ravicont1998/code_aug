    <p sfm='is'>What is the Holy Bible? </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The Holy Bible is a collection of books and letters written by many people
      who were inspired by the Holy Spirit of God. These books tell us how we
      can be saved from the evil of this world and gain eternal life that is
      truly worth living. Although the Holy Bible contains rules of conduct, it
      is not just a rule book. It reveals God?s heart?a Father?s heart, full of
      love and compassion. The Holy Bible tells you what you need to know and
      believe to be saved from sin and evil and how to live a life that is truly
      worth living, no matter what your current circumstances may be.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The Holy Bible consists of two main sections: the Old Testament (including
      Psalms and Proverbs) and the New Testament (Matthew through Revelation).
      The Old Testament records God?s interaction with mankind before He sent
      His son to redeem us, while recording prophesy predicting that coming. The
      New Testament tells us of God?s Son and Anointed One, Jesus, and the
      wonderful salvation that He purchased for us.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Holy Bible is living among us today,
      and He is happy to help you understand what He intended as you study His
      Word. Just ask Him, and He is more than happy to help you apply His
      message to your life.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The Old Testament was originally written mostly in Hebrew. The New
      Testament was originally written mostly in the common street Greek (not
      the formal Greek used for official legal matters). The Holy Bible is
      translated into many languages, and being translated into many more, so
      that everyone may have an opportunity to hear the Good News about Jesus
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p sfm='is'>Why was the World English Bible translated? </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      There are already many good translations of the Holy Bible into
      contemporary English. Unfortunately, almost all of them are restricted by
      copyright and copyright holder policy. This restricts publication and
      republication of God?s Word in many ways, such as in downloadable files on
      the Internet, use of extensive quotations in books, etc. The World English
      Bible was commissioned by God in response to prayer about this subject.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      Because the World English Bible is in the Public Domain (not copyrighted),
      it can be freely copied, distributed, and redistributed without any
      payment of royalties. You don?t even have to ask permission to do so. You
      may publish the whole World English Bible in book form, bind it in leather
      and sell it. You may incorporate it into your Bible study software. You
      may make and distribute audio recordings of it. You may broadcast it. All
      you have to do is maintain the integrity of God?s Word before God, and
      reserve the name ?World English Bible? for faithful copies of this
      translation.
    </p>
    <p sfm='is'>How was the World English Bible translated? </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The World English Bible is an update of the American Standard Version
      (ASV) of the Holy Bible, published in 1901. A custom computer program
      updated the archaic words and word forms to contemporary equivalents, and
      then a team of volunteers proofread and updated the grammar. The New
      Testament was updated to conform to the Majority Text reconstruction of
      the original Greek manuscripts, thus taking advantage of the superior
      access to manuscripts that we have now compared to when the original ASV
      was translated.
    </p>
    <p sfm='is'>What is different about the World English Bible? </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The style of the World English Bible, while fairly literally translated,
      is in informal, spoken English. The World English Bible is designed to
      sound good and be accurate when read aloud. It is not formal in its
      language, just as the original Greek of the New Testament was not formal.
      The WEB uses contractions rather freely.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The World English Bible doesn?t capitalize pronouns pertaining to God. The
      original manuscripts made no such distinction. Hebrew has no such thing as
      upper and lower case, and the original Greek manuscripts were written in
      all upper case letters. Attempting to add in such a distinction raises
      some difficulties in translating dual-meaning Scriptures such as the
      coronation psalms.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The World English Bible main edition translates God?s Proper Name in the
      Old Testament as ?Yahweh.? The Messianic Edition and the British Edition
      of the World English Bible translates the same name as ?LORD? (all capital
      letters), or when used with ?Lord? (mixed case, translated from ?Adonai?,)
      GOD. There are solid translational arguments for both traditions.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      Because World English Bible uses the Majority Text as the basis for the
      New Testament, you may notice the following differences in comparing the
      WEB to other translations:
    </p>
    <p sfm='ili'>
      The order of
      <ref tgt='MAT.23.13'>Matthew 23:13</ref>
       and
      <ref tgt='MAT.23.14'>14</ref>
       is reversed in some translations.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ili'>
      <ref tgt='LUK.17.36'>Luke 17:36</ref>
       and
      <ref tgt='ACT.15.34'>Acts 15:34</ref>
      , which are not found in the majority of the Greek Manuscripts (and are
      relegated to footnotes in the WEB) may be included in some other
      translations.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ili'>
      <ref tgt='ROM.14.24'>Romans 14:24-26</ref>
       in the WEB may appear as
      <ref tgt='ROM.16.25'>Romans 16:25-27</ref>
       in other translations.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ili'>
      <ref tgt='1JN.5.7'>1 John 5:7-8</ref>
       contains an addition in some translations, including the KJV. Erasmus
      admitted adding this text to his published Greek New Testament, even
      though he could at first find no Greek manuscript support for it, because
      he was being pressured by men to do so, and because he didn?t see any
      doctrinal harm in it. Lots of things not written by John in this letter
      are true, but we decline to add them to what the Holy Spirit inspired
      through John.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      With all of the above and some other places where lack of clarity in the
      original manuscripts has led to multiple possible readings, significant
      variants are listed in footnotes. The reading that in our prayerful
      judgment is best is in the main text. Overall, the World English Bible
      isn?t very much different than several other good contemporary English
      translations of the Holy Bible. The message of Salvation through Jesus
      Christ is still the same. The point of this translation was not to be very
      different (except for legal status), but to update the ASV for readability
      while retaining or improving the accuracy of that well-respected
      translation and retaining the public domain status of the ASV.
    </p>
    <p sfm='is'>Does the World English Bible include the Apocrypha? </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The World English Bible is an ecumenical project that includes books
      included in Bibles in many denominations. The main 66 books of the Old and
      New Testaments are recognized as Scripture by all true Christians. There
      are also books considered to be part of, depending on which book and who
      you ask, Deuterocanon, Apocrypha, and Pseudepigrapha.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The following books and parts of books are recognized as Deuterocanonical
      Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek, and Russian Orthodox Churches:
      Tobit, Judith, Esther from the Greek Septuagint, The Wisdom of Solomon,
      Ecclesiasticus or the Wisdom of Jesus Son of Sirach, Baruch, The Letter of
      Jeremiah (sometimes included as chapter 6 of Baruch), Daniel from the
      Greek Septuagint (including the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the
      Three Jews, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon), 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees. If
      you count the Greek Esther as one book and the extra parts of Daniel found
      in the Greek but not the Hebrew Old Testament as separate books, that
      makes a total of 88 books in the Roman Catholic Bible.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The following books are recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the
      Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches, but not the Roman Catholic Church: 1
      Esdras, The Prayer of Manasseh,
      <ref tgt='PSA.151.1'>Psalm 151,</ref>
       and 3 Maccabees. Note that 1 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh are also
      in an appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The Slavonic Bible includes 2 Esdras, but calls it 3 Esdras. This same
      book is in the Appendix to the Latin Vulgate as 4 Esdras.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      An appendix to the Greek Septuagint contains 4 Maccabees. It is included
      for its historical value.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      The World English Bible: Messianic Edition and World English Bible British
      Messianic Edition do not include any of the Apocryphal books, since they
      are not considered Scripture in the Hebrew tradition.
    </p>
    <p sfm='ip'>
      Among Christian denominations, opinions vary widely on these books, as do
      the collective names they give them. Many regard them as useful in gaining
      additional understanding of the Old and New Testaments and the hand of God
      in history, even if they don?t give them the same status as the 66 books
      of the Old and New Testaments. They are included here in support of the
      churches and individuals who read them and use them, as separate from, but
      frequently used with, the core canon of the 66 books of the Holy Bible.
