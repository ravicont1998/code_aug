<h3 class="section_title">3. Use the active voice.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the
passive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is much better than</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise.
If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting "by
me,"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it becomes indefinite: is it the writer, or some person
undisclosed, or the world at large, that will always remember this
visit?</p>
<p>This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should
entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient
and sometimes necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed
to-day.</p>
<p>Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the
Restoration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first would be the right form in a paragraph on the
dramatists of the Restoration; the second, in a paragraph on the
tastes of modern readers. The need of making a particular word the
subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine
which voice is to be used.</p>
<p>The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for
forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative principally
concerned with action, but in writing of any kind. Many a tame
sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and
emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some
such perfunctory expression as there is, or could be heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the
ground.<br />
Dead leaves covered the ground.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The sound of the falls could still be heard.<br />
The sound of the falls still reached our ears.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The reason that he left college was that his health became
impaired.<br />
Failing health compelled him to leave college.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what
he had.<br />
He soon repented his words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon
another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold was not allowed to be exported.<br />
It was forbidden to export gold (The export of gold was
prohibited).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He has been proved to have been seen entering the
building.<br />
It has been proved that he was seen to enter the building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both the examples above, before correction, the word properly
related to the second passive is made the subject of the first.</p>
<p>A common fault is to use as the subject of a passive
construction a noun which expresses the entire action, leaving to
the verb no function beyond that of completing the sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A survey of this region was made in 1900.<br />
This region was surveyed in 1900.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Mobilization of the army was rapidly carried out.<br />
The army was rapidly mobilized.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Confirmation of these reports cannot be obtained.<br />
These reports cannot be confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare the sentence, "The export of gold was prohibited," in
which the predicate "was prohibited" expresses something not
implied in "export."</p>
