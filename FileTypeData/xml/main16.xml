<h3 class="section_title">8. Keep related words together.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The position of the words in a sentence is the principal means
of showing their relationship. The writer must therefore, so far as
possible, bring together the words, and groups of words, that are
related in thought, and keep apart those which are not so
related.</p>
<p>The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as
a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred
to the beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute
description of this church.<br />
In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute
description of this church.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Cast iron, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is changed into
steel.<br />
By treatment in a Bessemer converter, cast iron is changed into
steel.</p>

<p>The objection is that the interposed phrase or clause needlessly
interrupts the natural order of the main clause. This objection,
however, does not usually hold when the order is interrupted only
by a relative clause or by an expression in apposition. Nor does it
hold in periodic sentences in which the interruption is a
deliberately used means of creating suspense (see examples under
Rule 18).</p>
<p>The relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after
its antecedent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a look in his eye that boded mischief.<br />
In his eye was a look that boded mischief.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which
were published in Harper's Magazine.<br />

adventures in Spain.</p>

<p>This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William
Henry Harrison, who became President in 1889.<br />
This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry
Harrison. He became President in 1889.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the antecedent consists of a group of words, the relative
comes at the end of the group, unless this would cause
ambiguity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Superintendent of the Chicago Division, who<br />
A proposal to amend the Sherman Act, which has been variously
judged</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A proposal, which has been variously judged, to amend the
Sherman Act<br />
A proposal to amend the much-debated Sherman Act</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The grandson of William Henry Harrison, who<br />
William Henry Harrison's grandson, Benjamin Harrison, who</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A noun in apposition may come between antecedent and relative,
because in such a combination no real ambiguity can arise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Duke of York, his brother, who was regarded with hostility
by the Whigs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modifiers should come, if possible next to the word they modify.
If several expressions modify the same word, they should be so
arranged that no wrong relation is suggested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the members were not present.<br />
Not all the members were present.</p>

He found only two mistakes.</p>
