<h3 class="section_title">8. Divide words at line-ends, in
accordance with their formation and pronunciation.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If there is room at the end of a line for one or more syllables
of a word, but not for the whole word, divide the word, unless this
involves cutting off only a single letter, or cutting off only two
letters of a long word. No hard and fast rule for all words can be
laid down. The principles most frequently applicable are:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>&#160;Divide the word according to its
formation:&#160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>know-ledge (not knowl-edge); Shake-speare (not Shakes-peare);
de-scribe (not des-cribe); atmo-sphere (not atmos-phere);</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Divide "on the vowel:"&#160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>edi-ble (not ed-ible); propo-sition; ordi-nary; espe-cial;
reli-gious; oppo-nents; regu-lar; classi-fi-ca-tion (three
divisions possible); deco-rative; presi-dent;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Divide between double letters, unless they
come at the end of the simple form of the word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apen-nines; Cincin-nati; refer-ring; but tell-ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treatment of consonants in combination is best shown from
examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for-tune; pic-ture; presump-tuous; illus-tration; sub-stan-tial
(either division); indus-try; instruc-tion; sug-ges-tion;
incen-diary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The student will do well to examine the syllable-division in a
number of pages of any carefully printed book.</p>
