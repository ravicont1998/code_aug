		<method args="" usesStandardInput="true">
			Reads from the standard input and compares adjacent lines, writing
			one copy  of each input line to the standard output. The second and 
			succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines are not written
			to the output.
			
			Note that repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are 
			not adjacent (see --global or -g option); sorted input lines always
			result in unique output lines. 
		</method>
		<method args="args" usesStandardInput="true">
			Reads the file specified by the {@code "--path"} operand (the 
			default operand) and writes only unique lines to the standard 
			output. The second and succeeding copies of repeated input lines are 
			not written to the output.
			
			Options can be specified by acronym (with a leading dash "-") or by 
			long name (with two leading dashes "--"). Operands other than the 
			default "--path" operand have to be prefixed with the operand name. 

			Note that repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are 
			not adjacent unless the --global is specified (sorted input lines 
			always result in unique output lines).
