<h3 class="section_title">5. Do not join independent clauses by a
comma.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by
a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper
mark of punctuation is a semicolon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting
adventures.</p>
<p>It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before
dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of course equally correct to write the above as two
sentences each, replacing the semicolons by periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stevenson's romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting
adventures.</p>
<p>It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before
dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a conjunction is inserted, the proper mark is a comma (Rule
4).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of
exciting adventures.</p>
<p>It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before
dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as
accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore, or thus, and not by a
conjunction, the semicolon is still required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in
finding my way about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, however, it is best, in writing, to avoid using so
in this manner; there is danger that the writer who uses it at all
may use it too often. A simple correction, usually serviceable, is
to omit the word so, and begin the first clause with as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in
finding my way about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is
usually permissible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man proposes, God disposes.</p>
<p>The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn
up.</p>
</blockquote>
