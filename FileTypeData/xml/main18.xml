<h3 class="section_title">10. Place the emphatic words of a
sentence at the end.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The proper place for the word, or group of words, which the
writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end of the
sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time,
though it has advanced in many other ways.<br />
Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it
has hardly advanced in fortitude.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its
hardness.<br />
Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making
razors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word or group of words entitled to this position of
prominence is usually the logical predicate, that is,
the&#160;<em>new</em>&#160;element in the sentence, as it is in the
second example.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the
prominence which it gives to the main statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, one of the Italian
mariners whom the decline of their own republics had put at the
service of the world and of adventure, seeking for Spain a westward
passage to the Indies as a set-off against the achievements of
Portuguese discoverers, lighted on America.</p>
<p>With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying
aside all hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote
yourselves unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and
successful prosecution of this war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning.
Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, becomes
emphatic when placed first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deceit or treachery he could never forgive.</p>
<p>So vast and rude, fretted by the action of nearly three thousand
years, the fragments of this architecture may often seem, at first
sight, like works of nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic, but
hardly by its position alone. In the sentence,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great kings worshipped at his shrine,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the emphasis upon&#160;<em>kings</em>&#160;arises largely from
its meaning and from the context. To receive special emphasis, the
subject of a sentence must take the position of the predicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most
prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to
the sentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a
composition.</p>
