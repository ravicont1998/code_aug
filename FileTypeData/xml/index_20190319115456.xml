      <description>At the beginning of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve started an experiment with reclaiming my time from social networks. Besides setting time limits to Instagram and Twitter apps on the phone, I&amp;rsquo;ve also deleted facebook application, unfollowed everyone in facebook and deleted all my content there. I was pretty surprised with the results I&amp;rsquo;ve got. Previously, I often found myself reloading FB feed to get new or missed posts. That now makes absolutely no sense, as I always see &amp;ldquo;No new posts.</description>
