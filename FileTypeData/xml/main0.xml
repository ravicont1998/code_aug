<div class="text">
<p>This book is intended for use in English courses in which the
practice of composition is combined with the study of literature.
It aims to give in a brief space the principal requirements of
plain English style. It aims to lighten the task of instructor and
student by concentrating attention (in Chapters II and III) on a
few essentials, the rules of usage and principles of composition
most commonly violated. The numbers of the sections may be used as
references in correcting manuscript.</p>
<p>The book covers only a small portion of the field of English
style, but the experience of its writer has been that once past the
essentials, students profit most by individual instruction based on
the problems of their own work, and that each instructor has his
own body of theory, which he prefers to that offered by any
textbook.</p>
<p>The writer's colleagues in the Department of English in Cornell
University have greatly helped him in the preparation of his
manuscript. Mr. George McLane Wood has kindly consented to the
inclusion under Rule 11 of some material from
his&#160;<em>Suggestions to Authors</em>.</p>
<p>The following books are recommended for reference or further
study: in connection with Chapters II and IV:</p>

</ul>
<p>It is an old observation that the best writers sometimes
disregard the rules of rhetoric. When they do so, however, the
reader will usually find in the sentence some compensating merit,
attained at the cost of the violation. Unless he is certain of
doing as well, he will probably do best to follow the rules. After
he has learned, by their guidance, to write plain English adequate
for everyday uses, let him look, for the secrets of style, to the
study of the masters of literature.</p>
