Few Matters of Form</h2>
<div class="text">
<p><strong>Headings.</strong></p>
<p>Leave a blank line, or its equivalent in space, after the title
or heading of a manuscript. On succeeding pages, if using ruled
paper, begin on the first line .</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Numerals.</strong></p>
<p>Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in
figures or in Roman notation, as may be appropriate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August 9, 1918</p>
<p>Chapter XII</p>
<p>Rule 3</p>
<p>352d Infantry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Parentheses.</strong></p>
<p>A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is
punctuated, outside of the marks of parenthesis, exactly as if the
expression in parenthesis were absent. The expression within is
punctuated as if it stood by itself, except that the final stop is
omitted unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to his house yesterday (my third attempt to see him), but
he had left town.</p>
<p>He declares (and why should we doubt his good faith?) that he is
now certain of success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(When a wholly detached expression or sentence is parenthesized,
the final stop comes before the last mark of parenthesis.)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Quotations.</strong></p>
<p>Formal quotations, cited as documentary evidence, are introduced
by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The provision of the Constitution is: "No tax or duty shall be
laid on articles exported from any state."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quotations grammatically in apposition or the direct objects of
verbs are preceded by a comma and enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recall the maxim of La Rochefoucauld, "Gratitude is a lively
sense of benefits to come."</p>
<p>Aristotle says, "Art is an imitation of nature."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quotations of an entire line, or more, of verse, are begun on a
fresh line and centred, but not enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wordsworth's enthusiasm for the Revolution was at first
unbounded:</p>
<p>Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,</p>
<p>But to be young was very heaven!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quotations introduced by that are regarded as in indirect
discourse and not enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keats declares that beauty is truth, truth beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin
require no quotation marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are the times that try men's souls.</p>
<p>He lives far from the madding crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same is true of colloquialisms and slang.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>References.</strong></p>
<p>In scholarly work requiring exact references, abbreviate titles
that occur frequently, giving the full forms in an alphabetical
list at the end. As a general practice, give the references in
parenthesis or in footnotes, not in the body of the sentence. Omit
the words act, scene, line, book, volume, page, except when
referring by only one of them. Punctuate as indicated below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second scene of the third act<br />
In III.ii (still better, simply insert III.ii in parenthesis at the
proper place in the sentence)</p>
<p>After the killing of Polonius, Hamlet is placed under guard (IV.
ii. 14).</p>
<p>2 Samuel i:17-27<br />
Othello II.iii 264-267, III.iii. 155-161</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Titles.</strong></p>
<p>For the titles of literary works, scholarly usage prefers
italics with capitalized initials. The usage of editors and
publishers varies, some using italics with capitalized initials,
others using Roman with capitalized initials and with or without
quotation marks. Use italics (indicated in manuscript by
underscoring), except in writing for a periodical that follows a
different practice. Omit initial A or The from titles when you
place the possessive before them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The&#160;<em>Iliad</em>; the&#160;<em>Odyssey</em>;&#160;<em>As
You Like It</em>;&#160;<em>To a Skylark</em>;&#160;<em>The
Newcomes</em>;&#160;<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>;
Dickens's&#160;<em>Tale of Two Cities</em>.</p>
