Words and Expressions Commonly Misused</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>(Many of the words and expressions here listed are not so much
bad English as bad style, the commonplaces of careless writing. As
illustrated under&#160;<em>Feature</em>, the proper correction is
likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of words by
another, but the replacement of vague generality by definite
statement.)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>All right.</strong></p>
<p>Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense,
"Agreed," or "Go ahead." In other uses better avoided. Always
written as two words.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>As good or better.</strong></p>
<p>Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the
sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My opinion is as good or better than his.</p>
<p>My opinion is as good as his, or better (if not better).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>As to whether.</strong></p>
<p><em>Whether</em>&#160;is sufficient; see under Rule 13.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Bid.</strong></p>
<p>Takes the infinitive without&#160;<em>to</em>. The past tense
is&#160;<em>bade</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Case.</strong></p>
<p>The&#160;<em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>&#160;begins its
definition of this word: "instance of a thing's occurring; usual
state of affairs." In these two senses, the word is usually
unnecessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated.<br />
Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been
made.<br />
Few mistakes have been made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Wood,&#160;<em>Suggestions to Authors</em>, pp. 68-71, and
Quiller-Couch,&#160;<em>The Art of Writing</em>, pp. 103-106.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Certainly.</strong></p>
<p>Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others
use&#160;<em>very</em>, to intensify any and every statement. A
mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in
writing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Character.</strong></p>
<p>Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts of a hostile character<br />
Hostile acts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Claim, vb.</strong></p>
<p>With object-noun, means&#160;<em>lay claim to</em>. May be used
with a dependent clause if this sense is clearly involved: "He
claimed that he was the sole surviving heir." (But even here,
"claimed to be" would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute
for&#160;<em>declare</em>,&#160;<em>maintain</em>,
or&#160;<em>charge</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Compare.</strong></p>
<p>To&#160;<em>compare to</em>&#160;is to point out or imply
resemblances, between objects regarded as essentially of different
order; to&#160;<em>compare with</em>&#160;is mainly to point out
differences, between objects regarded as essentially of the same
order. Thus life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to
a battle; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament.
Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with
modern London.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Clever.</strong></p>
<p>This word has been greatly overused; it is best restricted to
ingenuity displayed in small matters.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Consider.</strong></p>
<p>Not followed by&#160;<em>as</em>&#160;when it means, "believe to
be." "I consider him thoroughly competent." Compare, "The lecturer
considered Cromwell first as soldier and second as administrator,"
where "considered" means "examined" or "discussed."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Dependable.</strong></p>
<p>A needless substitute
for&#160;<em>reliable</em>,&#160;<em>trustworthy</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Due to.</strong></p>
<p>Incorrectly used for&#160;<em>through</em>,&#160;<em>because
of</em>, or&#160;<em>owing to</em>, in adverbial phrases: "He lost
the first game, due to carelessness." In correct use related as
predicate or as modifier to a particular noun: "This invention is
due to Edison;" "losses due to preventable fires."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Effect.</strong></p>
<p>As noun, means&#160;<em>result</em>; as verb, means&#160;<em>to
bring about</em>,&#160;<em>accomplish</em>&#160;(not to be confused
with&#160;<em>affect</em>, which means "to influence").</p>
<p>As noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about
fashions, music, painting, and other arts: "an Oriental effect;"
"effects in pale green;" "very delicate effects;" "broad effects;"
"subtle effects;" "a charming effect was produced by." The writer
who has a definite meaning to express will not take refuge in such
vagueness.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Etc.</strong></p>
<p>Not to be used of persons. Equivalent to&#160;<em>and the
rest</em>,&#160;<em>and so forth</em>, and hence not to be used if
one of these would be insufficient, that is, if the reader would be
left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to
objection when it represents the last terms of a list already given
in full, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation.</p>
<p>At the end of a list introduced by&#160;<em>such
as</em>,&#160;<em>for example</em>, or any similar expression, etc.
is incorrect.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Fact.</strong></p>
<p>Use this word only of matters of a kind capable of direct
verification, not of matters of judgment. That a particular event
happened on a given date, that lead melts at a certain temperature,
are facts. But such conclusions as that Napoleon was the greatest
of modern generals, or that the climate of California is
delightful, however incontestable they may be, are not properly
facts.</p>
<p>On the formula&#160;<em>the fact that</em>, see under Rule
13.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Factor.</strong></p>
<p>A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it forms part can
usually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His superior training was the great factor in his winning the
match.<br />
He won the match by being better trained.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Heavy artillery is becoming an increasingly important factor in
deciding battles.<br />
Heavy artillery is playing a larger and larger part in deciding
battles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Feature.</strong></p>
<p>Another hackneyed word; like&#160;<em>factor</em>&#160;it
usually adds nothing to the sentence in which it occurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A feature of the entertainment especially worthy of mention was
the singing of Miss A.<br />
(Better use the same number of words to tell what Miss A. sang, or
if the programme has already been given, to tell something of how
she sang.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a verb, in the advertising sense of&#160;<em>offer as a
special attraction</em>, to be avoided.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Fix.</strong></p>
<p>Colloquial in America
for&#160;<em>arrange</em>,&#160;<em>prepare</em>,&#160;<em>mend</em>.
In writing restrict it to its literary
senses,&#160;<em>fasten</em>,&#160;<em>make firm or immovable</em>,
etc.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>He is a man who.</strong></p>
<p>A common type of redundant expression; see Rule 13.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a man who is very ambitious.<br />
He is very ambitious.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Spain is a country which I have always wanted to visit.<br />
I have always wanted to visit Spain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>However.</strong></p>
<p>In the meaning&#160;<em>nevertheless</em>, not to come first in
its sentence or clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded
in reaching camp.</p>
<p>The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded
in reaching camp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When&#160;<em>however</em>&#160;comes first, it
means&#160;<em>in whatever way</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>to whatever
extent</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks
best.</p>
<p>However discouraging the prospect, he never lost heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Kind of.</strong></p>
<p>Not to be used as a substitute
for&#160;<em>rather</em>&#160;(before adjectives and verbs), or
except in familiar style, for&#160;<em>something
like</em>&#160;(before nouns). Restrict it to its literal sense:
"Amber is a kind of fossil resin;" "I dislike that kind of
notoriety." The same holds true of&#160;<em>sort of</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Less.</strong></p>
<p>Should not be misused for&#160;<em>fewer</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had less men than in the previous campaign.<br />
He had fewer men than in the previous campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Less</em>&#160;refers to
quantity,&#160;<em>fewer</em>&#160;to number. "His troubles are
less than mine" means "His troubles are not so great as mine." "His
troubles are fewer than mine" means "His troubles are not so
numerous as mine." It is, however, correct to say, "The signers of
the petition were less than a hundred," where the round number, a
hundred, is something like a collective noun,
and&#160;<em>less</em>&#160;is thought of as meaning a less
quantity or amount.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Line, along these lines.</strong></p>
<p><em>Line</em>&#160;in the sense of&#160;<em>course of
procedure</em>,&#160;<em>conduct</em>,&#160;<em>thought</em>, is
allowable, but has been so much overworked, particularly in the
phrase&#160;<em>along these lines</em>, that a writer who aims at
freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. B. also spoke along the same lines.<br />
Mr. B. also spoke, to the same effect.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He is studying along the line of French literature.<br />
He is studying French literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Literal, literally.</strong></p>
<p>Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent
metaphor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A literal flood of abuse<br />
A flood of abuse</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Literally dead with fatigue<br />
Almost dead with fatigue (dead tired)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Lose out.</strong></p>
<p>Meant to be more emphatic than&#160;<em>lose</em>, but actually
less so, because of its commonness. The same holds true
of&#160;<em>try out</em>,&#160;<em>win out</em>,&#160;<em>sign
up</em>,<em>register up</em>. With a number of
verbs,&#160;<em>out</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>up</em>&#160;form
idiomatic combinations:&#160;<em>find out</em>,&#160;<em>run
out</em>,&#160;<em>turn out</em>,&#160;<em>cheer
up</em>,&#160;<em>dry up</em>,&#160;<em>make up</em>, and others,
each distinguishable in meaning from the simple verb.&#160;<em>Lose
out</em>&#160;is not.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Most.</strong></p>
<p>Not to be used for&#160;<em>almost</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most everybody<br />
Almost everybody</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Most all the time<br />
Almost all the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Nature.</strong></p>
<p>Often simply redundant, used like&#160;<em>character</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts of a hostile nature<br />
Hostile acts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often vaguely used in such expressions as "a lover of nature;"
"poems about nature." Unless more specific statements follow, the
reader cannot tell whether the poems have to do with natural
scenery, rural life, the sunset, the untracked wilderness, or the
habits of squirrels.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Near by.</strong></p>
<p>Adverbial phrase, not yet fully accepted as good English, though
the analogy of&#160;<em>close by</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>hard
by</em>&#160;seems to justify it.&#160;<em>Near</em>,
or&#160;<em>near at hand</em>, is as good, if not better.</p>
<p>Not to be used as an adjective;
use&#160;<em>neighboring</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Oftentimes, ofttimes.</strong></p>
<p>Archaic forms, no longer in good use. The modern word
is&#160;<em>often</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>One hundred and one.</strong></p>
<p>Retain the&#160;<em>and</em>&#160;in this and similar
expressions, in accordance with the unvarying usage of English
prose from Old English times.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>One of the most.</strong></p>
<p>Avoid beginning essays or paragraphs with this formula, as, "One
of the most interesting developments of modern science is, etc.;"
"Switzerland is one of the most interesting countries of Europe."
There is nothing wrong in this; it is simply threadbare and
forcible-feeble.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>People.</strong></p>
<p><em>The people</em>&#160;is a political term, not to be confused
with&#160;<em>the public</em>. From the people comes political
support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation
or commercial patronage.</p>
<p>The word&#160;<em>people</em>&#160;is not to be used with words
of number, in place of persons. If of "six people" five went away,
how many "people" would be left?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Phase.</strong></p>
<p>Means a stage of tran</p>
<p>sition or development: "the phases of the moon;" "the last
phase." Not to be used
for&#160;<em>aspect</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>topic</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another phase of the subject</p>
<p>Another point (another question)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Possess.</strong></p>
<p>Not to be used as a mere substitute
for&#160;<em>have</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>own</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He possessed great courage.<br />
He had great courage (was very brave).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He was the fortunate possessor of<br />
He owned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Respective, respectively.</strong></p>
<p>These words may usually be omitted with advantage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Works of fiction are listed under the names of their respective
authors.<br />
Works of fiction are listed under the names of their authors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and Cummings
respectively.<br />
The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and by
Cummings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some kinds of formal writing, as in geometrical proofs, it
may be necessary to use&#160;<em>respectively</em>, but it should
not appear in writing on ordinary subjects.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>So.</strong></p>
<p>Avoid, in writing, the use of&#160;<em>so</em>&#160;as an
intensifier: "so good;" "so warm;" "so delightful."</p>
<p>On the use of&#160;<em>so</em>&#160;to introduce clauses, see
Rule 4.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Sort of.</strong></p>
<p>See under&#160;<strong>Kind of</strong>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>State.</strong></p>
<p>Not to be used as a mere substitute
for&#160;<em>say</em>,&#160;<em>remark</em>. Restrict it to the
sense of&#160;<em>express fully or clearly</em>, as, "He refused to
state his objections."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Student body.</strong></p>
<p>A needless and awkward expression, meaning no more than the
simple word&#160;<em>students</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A member of the student body<br />
A student</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Popular with the student body<br />
Liked by the students</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The student body passed resolutions.<br />
The students passed resolutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>System.</strong></p>
<p>Frequently used without need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dayton has adopted the commission system of government.<br />
Dayton has adopted government by commission.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The dormitory system<br />
Dormitories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Thanking you in advance.</strong></p>
<p>This sounds as if the writer meant, "It will not be worth my
while to write to you again." Simply write, "Thanking you," and if
the favor which you have requested is granted, write a letter of
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>They.</strong></p>
<p>A common inaccuracy is the use of the plural pronoun when the
antecedent is a distributive expression such
as&#160;<em>each</em>,&#160;<em>each
one</em>,&#160;<em>everybody</em>,<em>every one</em>,&#160;<em>many
a man</em>, which, though implying more than one person, requires
the pronoun to be in the singular. Similar to this, but with even
less justification, is the use of the plural pronoun with the
antecedent&#160;<em>anybody</em>,&#160;<em>any
one</em>,&#160;<em>somebody</em>,&#160;<em>some one</em>, the
intention being either to avoid the awkward "he or she," or to
avoid committing oneself to either. Some bashful speakers even say,
"A friend of mine told me that they, etc."</p>
<p>Use&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;with all the above words, unless the
antecedent is or must be feminine.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Very.</strong></p>
<p>Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words
strong in themselves.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Viewpoint.</strong></p>
<p>Write&#160;<em>point of view</em>, but do not misuse this, as
many do, for&#160;<em>view</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>opinion</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>While.</strong></p>
<p>Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word
for&#160;<em>and</em>,&#160;<em>but</em>,
and&#160;<em>although</em>. Many writers use it frequently as a
substitute for&#160;<em>and</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>but</em>, either
from a mere desire to vary the connective, or from uncertainty
which of the two connectives is the more appropriate. In this use
it is best replaced by a semicolon.</p>
<p>This is entirely correct, as shown by the paraphrase,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor, while the
rest of the building is devoted to manufacturing.</p>
<p>The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor; the rest of
the building is devoted to manufacturing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its use as a virtual equivalent
of&#160;<em>although</em>&#160;is allowable in sentences where this
leads to no ambiguity or absurdity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I admire his energy, I wish it were employed in a better
cause.</p>
<p>I admire his energy; at the same time I wish it were employed in
a better cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime,
the nights are often chilly.</p>
<p>Although the temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the
daytime, the nights are often chilly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paraphrase,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime; at the
same time the nights are often chilly,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>shows why the use of&#160;<em>while</em>&#160;is incorrect.</p>
<p>In general, the writer will do well to
use&#160;<em>while</em>&#160;only with strict literalness, in the
sense of&#160;<em>during the time that</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Whom.</strong></p>
<p>Often incorrectly used
for&#160;<em>who</em>&#160;before&#160;<em>he said</em>&#160;or
similar expressions, when it is really the subject of a following
verb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His brother, whom he said would send him the money<br />
His brother, who he said would send him the money</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The man whom he thought was his friend<br />
The man who (that) he thought was his friend (whom he thought his
friend)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Worth while.</strong></p>
<p>Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with not) of
disapproval. Strictly applicable only to actions: "Is it worth
while to telegraph?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His books are not worth while.</p>
<p>His books are not worth reading (not worth one's while to read;
do not repay reading).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of worth&#160;<em>while</em>&#160;before a noun ("a
worth while story") is indefensible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Would.</strong></p>
<p>A conditional statement in the first person
requires&#160;<em>should</em>, not&#160;<em>would</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should not have succeeded without his help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The equivalent of&#160;<em>shall</em>&#160;in indirect quotation
after a verb in the past tense is&#160;<em>should</em>,
not&#160;<em>would</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He predicted that before long we should have a great
surprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense,
without&#160;<em>would</em>, is usually sufficient, and from its
brevity, more emphatic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a year he would visit the old mansion.</p>
<p>Once a year he visited the old mansion.</p>
