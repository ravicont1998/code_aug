	<methods>
		<method args="args" usesStandardInput="true">
			Filters the input lines from the standard input or the provided 
			input files and writes the matching lines to the standard output. A 
			line matches if it contains the given {@code "--regexp"} operand
			value (default operand).
			
			Options can be specified by acronym (with a leading dash "-") or by 
			long name (with two leading dashes "--"). Operands other than the 
			default "--regexp" and "--paths" operands have to be prefixed with 
			the operand name. 
		</method>
		<method args="regexp" usesStandardInput="true">
			Filters the input lines from the standard input and writes the
			matching lines to the standard output. A line matches if it contains 
			the given {@code regexp} using case-sensitive string comparison.
		</method>
		<method args="regexp,files" usesStandardInput="false">
			Filters the lines from the specified input files and writes the
			matching lines to the standard output. Every line is matched against
			the given {@code regexp} string using case-sensitive comparison. 
			Line endings are not relevant for the comparison.
		</method>
		<method args="pattern" usesStandardInput="true">
			Filters the input lines from the standard input and writes the
			matching lines to the standard output. Every line is matched against
			the given regular expression {@code pattern} using case-sensitive 
			comparison. Line endings are not relevant for the comparison.

			Filters the lines from the specified input files and writes the
			matching lines to the standard output. Every line is matched against

		<method args="pattern,paths" usesStandardInput="false">
			Filters the lines from the specified input files and writes the
			matching lines to the standard output. Every line is matched against
			the given regular expression {@code pattern} using case-sensitive 
			comparison. Line endings are not relevant for the comparison.
		</method>
		<method args="options,regexp" usesStandardInput="true">
			Filters the input lines from the standard input and writes the

	<options>
		<option name="ignoreCase" acronym="i">
			Match lines ignoring the case when comparing the strings, also known
			from Unix with its acronym 'i'.
		</option>
		<option name="invertMatch" acronym="v">
			Invert the match result, that is, a non-matching line is written to
			the output and a matching line is not. This option is also known 
			from Unix with its acronym 'v'.
		</option>
		<option name="fixedStrings" acronym="F">
			Use fixed-strings matching instead of regular expressions. This is
			usually faster than the standard regexp version.
			
			(This option is ignored if a {@code pattern} operand is specified
			instead of the {@code regexp} string).
		</option>
		<option name="lineNumber" acronym="n">
			Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input
			file.
		</option>
		<option name="count" acronym="c">
			Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for
			each input file. With the {@code -v}, {@code --invertMatch} option,
			count non-matching lines.
		</option>
		<option name="matchingFiles" acronym="l">
			Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file
			from which output would normally have been printed. The scanning
			will stop on the first match.
		</option>
		<option name="wholeLine" acronym="x">
			Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line
			excluding the terminating line ending.
			
			(This option is ignored if a {@code pattern} operand is specified
			instead of the {@code regexp} string).
		</option>
	</options>
	<operands default="regexp,paths">
		<operand name="regexp" type="String">
			Lines will be printed which match the given regular expression. The 
			{@code regexp} string is surrounded with ".*" on both sides unless
			the {@code --wholeLine} option is specified. If the 
			{@code --fixedStrings} option is used, plain string comparison is
			used instead of regular expression matching.
		</operand>
		<operand name="pattern" type="java.util.regex.Pattern">
			Lines will be printed which match the given pattern.
		</operand>
		<operand name="paths" type="String...">
			Pathnames of the input files to be searched for the pattern;
			wildcards * and ? are supported; relative paths are resolved on the
            basis of the current working directory.
		</operand>
		<operand name="files" type="java.io.File...">
			The input files to be searched for the pattern; relative paths are 
			not resolved (use the string paths argument to enable relative path 
			resolving based on the current working directory).
		</operand>
		<operand name="args" type="String...">
			String arguments defining the options and operands for the command. 
			Options can be specified by acronym (with a leading dash "-") or by 
			long name (with two leading dashes "--"). Operands other than the
			default "--pattern" and "--paths" operands have to be prefixed with
			the operand name (e.g. "--files" for subsequent file operand values). 
		</operand>
		<operand name="options" type="GrepOptions">
			The options defining the types of patterns and command behavior.
