<br/>Didn't reply to any of your comments,<br/>nor post any new stuffs here.<br/>?S???^?A????^??, ?]?S???s??.<br/>
<br/>Because I just finished importing the posts from Blogger to Word Press. *Finally*<br/>It took me 2 tries. The first failure was because I've uploaded to the wrong dir.<br/>?o???O?]??????~????o????????????Word Press?h.<br/>????F??, ??@??????O?]???F??Q?W???????a??.<br/>
<br/>Originally, I was thinking I'd post the new URL here once everything's finished.<br/>But I gradually figured that I wouldn't be able to finish all the renovation very soon.<br/>*with the current pace*<br/>????Q???????F??????~??a?}???G,<br/>???C?C??N??o, ?H??{?b???t??, ?n????s?a???????n, ????|?O?u?????????.<br/>
<br/>And some of you have actually discovered my new home.<br/>HAHA =)<br/>??B?A??@??H?]?w?g?o?{?F????s?a?}?F.<br/>
<br/>So, I'll announce my new address here now.<br/>*It's really raw, so if you go there, don't laugh at me =D*<br/>??H??M?w?{?b?N?i?D?A?????s?a?}.<br/>*?A?????, ?i???n?????! ?]???s?a??O????, ?????.*<br/>

<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://carbonxiv.blogspot.com" xml:space="preserve">&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Dined out a few times this week, but didn't find any real good restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;So-so, so-so, and so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to the i-cook buffet near Warden and Steeles.&lt;br /&gt;(Haven't had any hot-pot/shabu shabu since when?...)&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday night, around 7:30p.m. There weren't a lot of customers at i-cook.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Wednesday is supposed to be like that.&lt;br /&gt;But don't forget,&lt;br /&gt;right now all university students are having their holidays.&lt;br /&gt;Done w/ exam and not yet started summer school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ordered the seafood buffet for $17.99 (i.e. with $3 more, you'll get oysters, crabs, and some better veggies, plus all you can drink pops and other drinks) . The soup base we ordered was (1) Lobster base w/ 1 lb. of lobster for $9.99, (2) Mushroom soup base $3.99, and (3) Lamb + chinese herb (Dong-Guai) soup base $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The environment there was quite good. I'm sure most of the people will remember the big "round" screen TV there. It was playing S.H.E. and Jay Chou's Concert that night. The service was pretty good. They were pretty polite and often come by to see what we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let's talk about food selections. The thing I really like it the wide variety of sauces you can mix together yourself. (that's why it's called "i cook" right!) The food quality was average. There're quite a lot of fish/crab/lobster/shrimp/meat balls you can dump and cook in the soup. Unfortunately, the shrimp and the crab there were just NOT FRESH. I was kind of disappointed. Anyone can tell the shrimp was unfresh by just looking at the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say... the overall experience was so-so. The total came to be around $90 for three persons, and I don't think I'd recommend you going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=================================&lt;br /&gt;Went to Kelsey's on the same plaza (Steeles and Warden) on Saturday night around 9:30pm. It was a rainy night and there weren't a lot of people on the street or near the T&amp;T supermarket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Remember there was a period of time when I went to Kelsey's quite often. I especially liked the one on Steeles and Woodbine. It was relatively old; with the dim lights and not so many patrons, it gave me this feeling of escaping from the city and back to the 60's. Another special note is that this restaurant is not smoke-free. You can just sit in the designated area (an open area, not those little smoking room) and have a cigar or so. Yea,... but it's no longer there now. There now stand the restaurant/pub (not sure) called drInk. Haven't been there though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Yea... back to the topic. We went to the new Kelsey's and it was kinda late for dinner time. The main reason why we went to Kelsey's was partly because it was pretty close and we couldn't think of other places, also because we wanted to have the ribs. Unfortunately, they were out of ribs! Sigh... So what we ordered was a steak, a steak fajita and an onion soup... All of them were just so-so. No surprises... (yes, what do you expect?). I found it pretty hard to get a good french onion soup... So far, I think the one at the KEG is relatively good. Still remember how salty the one was at the La Biftheque. The one at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tickledtoad.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Tickled Toad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt; was a bit different from the other ones, but it was just ok (I basically just went there for the Monday wing special.) Arh... I really love the cheese on top of the french onion soup.~~~~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;==================================&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Another restaurant revisited was the "???" at Commerce Gate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Suddently wanted to have Japanese noodle... and couldn't think of anywhere I could get that... so drove up to the Commerce Gate and had the noodle there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Actually I really haven't had the noodle there before (except once I ordered a plain noodle w/ seaweed because I wasn't in a mood to eat that night). How it turned out this time? Wasn't too good. I guess I wouldn't go there (at least not when I'm the one making decision) next time. The Curry pork rice was so-so, the spicy tuna roll and the house noodle only scored a 5 out of 10. &gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
