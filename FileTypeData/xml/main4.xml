<h3 class="section_title">4. Place a comma before and or but
introducing an independent clause.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p>The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of
its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
<p>The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of
escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentences of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to
be in need of rewriting. As they make complete sense when the comma
is reached, the second clause has the appearance of an
after-thought. Further, and, is the least specific of connectives.
Used between independent clauses, it indicates only that a relation
exists between them without defining that relation. In the example
above, the relation is that of cause and result. The two sentences
might be rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of
its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
<p>Although the situation is perilous, there is still one chance of
escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the subordinate clauses might be replaced by phrases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city, the
story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
<p>In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of
escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a writer may err by making his sentences too uniformly
compact and periodic, and an occasional loose sentence prevents the
style from becoming too formal and gives the reader a certain
relief. Consequently, loose sentences of the type first quoted are
common in easy, unstudied writing. But a writer should be careful
not to construct too many of his sentences after this pattern (see
Rule 14).</p>
<p>Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by
as (in the sense of because), for, or, nor, and while (in the sense
of and at the same time) likewise require a comma before the
conjunction.</p>
<p>If a dependent clause, or an introductory phrase requiring to be
set off by a comma, precedes the second independent clause, no
comma is needed after the conjunction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act
promptly, there is still one chance of escape.</p>
