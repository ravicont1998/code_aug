<h3 class="section_title">2. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a
topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Again, the object is to aid the reader. The practice here
recommended enables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph
as he begins to read it, and to retain the purpose in mind as he
ends it. For this reason, the most generally useful kind of
paragraph, particularly in exposition and argument, is that in
which</p>
&lt;
<p>ol type="A"&gt;</p>
<p>the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning;</p>
<p>the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the
statement made in the topic sentence; and</p>
<p>the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic
sentence or states some important consequence.</p>
<p>Ending with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is
particularly to be avoided.</p>
<p>If the paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its
relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of the whole,
may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word
or phrase (again; therefore; for the same reason) in the topic
sentence. Sometimes, however, it is expedient to precede the topic
sentence by one or more sentences of introduction or transition. If
more than one such sentence is required, it is generally better to
set apart the transitional sentences as a separate paragraph.</p>
<p>According to the writer's purpose, he may, as indicated above,
relate the body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or
more of several different ways. He may make the meaning of the
topic sentence clearer by restating it in other forms, by defining
its terms, by denying the converse, by giving illustrations or
specific instances; he may establish it by proofs; or he may
develop it by showing its implications and consequences. In a long
paragraph, he may carry out several of these processes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Now, to be properly enjoyed, a walking tour should be gone
upon alone.<br />
1 Topic sentence.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>2 If you go in a company, or even in pairs, it is no longer a
walking tour in anything but name; it is something else and more in
the nature of a picnic.<br />
2 The meaning made clearer by denial of the contrary.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3 A walking tour should be gone upon alone, because freedom is
of the essence; because you should be able to stop and go on, and
follow this way or that, as the freak takes you; and because you
must have your own pace, and neither trot alongside a champion
walker, nor mince in time with a girl.<br />
3 The topic sentence repeated, in abridged form, and supported by
three reasons; the meaning of the third ("you must have your own
pace") made clearer by denying the converse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>4 And you must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts
take colour from what you see.<br />
4 A fourth reason, stated in two forms.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>5 You should be as a pipe for any wind to play upon.<br />
5 The same reason, stated in still another form.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>6 "I cannot see the wit," says Hazlitt, "of walking and talking
at the same time.<br />
7 When I am in the country, I wish to vegetate like the country,"
which is the gist of all that can be said upon the
matter.&#160;<br />
6-7 The same reason as stated by Hazlitt.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>8 There should be no cackle of voices at your elbow, to jar on
the meditative silence of the morning.<br />
8 Repetition, in paraphrase, of the quotation from Hazlitt.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>9 And so long as a man is reasoning he cannot surrender himself
to that fine intoxication that comes of much motion in the open
air, that begins in a sort of dazzle and sluggishness of the brain,
and ends in a peace that passes comprehension.?Stevenson, Walking
Tours.<br />
9 Final statement of the fourth reason, in language amplified and
heightened to form a strong conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 It was chiefly in the eighteenth century that a very different
conception of history grew up.<br />
1 Topic sentence.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>2 Historians then came to believe that their task was not so
much to paint a picture as to solve a problem; to explain or
illustrate the successive phases of national growth, prosperity,
and adversity.<br />
2 The meaning of the topic sentence made clearer; the new
conception of history defined.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3 The history of morals, of industry, of intellect, and of art;
the changes that take place in manners or beliefs; the dominant
ideas that prevailed in successive periods; the rise, fall, and
modification of political constitutions; in a word, all the
conditions of national well-being became the subjects of their
works.<br />
3 The definition expanded.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>4 They sought rather to write a history of peoples than a
history of kings.<br />
4 The definition explained by contrast.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>5 They looked especially in history for the chain of causes and
effects.<br />
5 The definition supplemented: another element in the new
conception of history.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>6 They undertook to study in the past the physiology of nations,
and hoped by applying the experimental method on a large scale to
deduce some lessons of real value about the conditions on which the
welfare of society mainly depend.?Lecky, The Political Value of
History.<br />
6 Conclusion: an important consequence of the new conception of
history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In narration and description the paragraph sometimes begins with
a concise, comprehensive statement serving to hold together the
details that follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The breeze served us admirably.<br />
The campaign opened with a series of reverses.<br />
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of
entries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this device, if too often used, would become a mannerism.
More commonly the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject
with what the paragraph is to be principally concerned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At length I thought I might return towards the stockade.<br />
He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to
explore.<br />
Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The brief paragraphs of animated narrative, however, are often
without even this semblance of a topic sentence. The break between
them serves the purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into
prominence some detail of the action.</p>
